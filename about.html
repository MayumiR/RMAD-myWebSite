            The XYZ campus has lots of green open spaces while being very close to Bedford town centre and local amenities. It boasts our Gateway building, a three-storey building that offers high-quality teaching spaces, informal learning spaces, lecture theatres and a new student services centre.

            In the Campus Centre you can find both of the campus Theatres as well as the main campus Caf√© while in the surrounding buildings you can find our Physical Education and Sport Science Centre which was used to train athletes in the 2012 Olympics, Teacher Education Centre, four dance studios, campus gym, our four-storey campus library and a newly refurbished Students' Union social space that holds a variety of student events such as pub quizzes, live music and various themed club nights.
